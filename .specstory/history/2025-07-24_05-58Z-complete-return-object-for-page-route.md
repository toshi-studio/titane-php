# Complete return object for page route (2025-07-24 05:58Z)

_**User**_

complete the return object of the page route with the page's fields

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll complete the return object for the page route by including all the page fields mentioned in the documentation.

---



---

I've completed the return object for the page route with all the page fields mentioned in the documentation. I also fixed the typo "oject" to "object". The return object now includes all page properties: title, slug, content, tags (which is null for pages as specified), description, open graph fields, project reference, timestamps, and author information.

---

_**User**_

add a paragraph for the article route. use the page route as reference of style

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I've added the article route section following the same style as the page route. The article route includes all the fields specific to articles as defined in the documentation, including the additional fields that articles have compared to pages: `tags` (as an array of strings), `summary`, and `published` state.

_**User**_

do the same for the form route

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Let me read the file to see the current content and find the right location to add the form route.

---

Read file: README.md

---



---

Let me read a larger section to get better context.

---

Read file: README.md

---

Now I can target the specific instance at the end of the file:

---

Let me read more context to understand the exact structure:

---

Read file: README.md

---

Now I can add the form route at the very end by targeting the unique ending:

---

Let me simply append to the end of the file:

Let me use the edit_file tool instead to append the content at the end:

```diff

  The content will include the transformed PHPBB content.

+ ### form route
+ #### Parameter
+ ```json
+ {
+     "project_uid": "string",
+     "form_slug": "string"
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ #### Return object
+ ```json
+ {
+     "name": "string (internal)",
+     "slug": "string",
+     "title": "string",
+     "text": "string",
+     "image": "string",
+     "fields": [
+         {
+             "id": "string",
+             "label": "string",
+             "name": "string",
+             "type": "text|email|phone|checkbox|radio",
+             "field_container_custom_class": "string",
+             "field_label_custom_class": "string",
+             "field_custom_class": "string",
+             "mandatory": "boolean"
+         }
+     ],
+     "project_uid": "string"
+ }
+ ```
  
  
```

---

I've added the form route section following the same style as the page and article routes. The form route includes all the fields defined in the subscription form manager section: name, slug, title, text, image, and the fields array with all their properties including the custom class fields and field types (text, email, phone, checkbox, radio).

_**User**_

add a route_html 

---

_**Assistant**_

```diff
  }
  ```
+ 
+ ### route_html
+ #### Parameter
+ ```json
+ {
+     "project_uid": "string",
+     "route": "string"
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ #### Return object
+ ```json
+ {
+     "html": "string"
+ }
+ ```
+ This route returns the fully rendered HTML for any page, article, or form based on the route parameter.
  
  
```

---

I've added the `route_html` section following the same style as the other API routes. This route takes a project UID and a route parameter, and returns the fully rendered HTML content. This would be useful for getting the complete HTML output including transformed PHPBB content for any page, article, or form in the system.

---

_**User**_

the described routes are GET routes as they are used to retrieve data. as a result the JSON parameter is not compatible. adapt the json parameter description so they are get parameters

---

_**Assistant**_



---



---



---



---

I've updated all the API routes to use GET parameters instead of JSON objects. Each route now lists its parameters as URL query parameters with their types and descriptions, which is the correct format for GET requests. The parameters are now properly formatted for GET routes where they would be passed as query strings in the URL.

---

_**User**_

this assertion "All routes will be `get` routes as the API" is false as we need to add a POST route for the forms submission

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I've corrected the assertion to accurately reflect that while most routes are GET routes for retrieving data, there will also be POST routes needed for form submissions.

---

_**User**_

add the form route for the submission

---

_**Assistant**_

```diff
  ```
  This route returns the fully rendered HTML for any page, article, or form based on the route parameter.
+ 
+ ### form_submit route (POST)
+ #### Parameters
+ ```json
+ {
+     "project_uid": "string",
+     "form_slug": "string",
+     "fields": {
+         "field_name": "field_value",
+         "field_name2": "field_value2"
+     }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ #### Return object
+ ```json
+ {
+     "success": "boolean",
+     "message": "string"
+ }
+ ```
+ This route handles form submissions and saves the subscriber data to the database.
  
   
```

---

I've added the `form_submit` POST route for handling form submissions. This route accepts the project UID, form slug, and the form field data as a JSON object. It returns a success status and message, and handles saving the subscriber data to the database as described in the subscription form manager section.
