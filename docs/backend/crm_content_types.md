# Content Types

## Projects

Each project is like a website and includes:

* Name
* Description
* URL
* UID
* Archived status (bool)

Archived projects are read-only and deletable by Admin/Super Admin.

## Pages

* Title
* Slug (unique per project)
* Content (HTML)
* Tags (optional)
* SEO: description, Open Graph image & description
* Project link
* Timestamps (created, updated)
* Author (pen name)
* Publication status: not published, published, draft
* Internationalization not supported

### Versioning

Stored in `page_versions` table with rollback support. **Drafts do not generate new versions.**

### Deletion

A page is first moved to the trash before being permanently deleted (along with its versions).

### UI

* Paginated table (20 items): title, tags, author, dates, tools
* Editor autosaves every 5 minutes

## Media Library

Attached per project. Authorized types:

* Images: jpg, png, webp
* Docs: doc, ppt, xls, pdf, and open equivalents
* Archive: zip

Limits: 2MB max size. No editing/resizing features.

### Deletion

Tracking usage of a media can't be done as we provide a public access link. As a result, the deletion must be a confimed action but we can not prevent the loss of access to everyone.

### UI 

* File type icon
* File name
* Alt text
* Size
* Actions: edit, delete, copy link
* Tags

# Tags

Tags help filter articles. They are:

* Project-specific
* Unique per project

## Form Properties:
